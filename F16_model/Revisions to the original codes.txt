Note that some files from the orginal link (https://archive.siam.org/books/dc11/) are revised. An original file xx.m is still kept in this folder, while the edited file is named as xx_rev.m and used in the controller design and simulation. Below is a list of editsFor jocobian_A(B/C/D).m:-change "new_dv=0.6*dv0;" to "new_dv=0.6*new_dv". In cost_f16.m:-add more state(4,5,6,11) penalties to the cost so that the derivatives of these states are zero at the equalibrium points; otherwise,the trim points are not accurate at certain conditions.
